            NORA.<br>
            Perhaps a little older; very, very little; certainly not much. _[Stops
            suddenly and speaks seriously.]_ What a thoughtless creature I am,
            chattering away like this. My poor, dear Christine, do forgive me.<br>
        
        
            MRS LINDE.<br>
            What do you mean, Nora?<br>

            NORA.<br>
            _[gently]_. Poor Christine, you are a widow.<br>

            MRS LINDE.<br>
            Yes; it is three years ago now.<br>

            NORA.<br>
            Yes, I knew; I saw it in the papers. I assure you, Christine, I meant
            ever so often to write to you at the time, but I always put it off and
            something always prevented me.<br>

            MRS LINDE.<br>
            I quite understand, dear.<br>

            NORA.<br>
            It was very bad of me, Christine. Poor thing, how you must have
            suffered. And he left you nothing?
