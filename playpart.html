            NORA.
            Perhaps a little older; very, very little; certainly not much. _[Stops
            suddenly and speaks seriously.]_ What a thoughtless creature I am,
            chattering away like this. My poor, dear Christine, do forgive me.

            MRS LINDE.
            What do you mean, Nora?

            NORA.
            _[gently]_. Poor Christine, you are a widow.

            MRS LINDE.
            Yes; it is three years ago now.

            NORA.
            Yes, I knew; I saw it in the papers. I assure you, Christine, I meant
            ever so often to write to you at the time, but I always put it off and
            something always prevented me.

            MRS LINDE.
            I quite understand, dear.

            NORA.
            It was very bad of me, Christine. Poor thing, how you must have
            suffered. And he left you nothing?
