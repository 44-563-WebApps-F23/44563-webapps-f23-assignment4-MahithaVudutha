        <h6 class="NORA">NORA.</h6>
            <p> Perhaps a little older; very, very little; certainly not much.</p>
            <p9 class="direction"> _[Stops suddenly and speaks seriously.]_ </p9>
            <p>a thoughtless creature I am,chattering away like this. My poor, dear Christine, 
            do forgive me.</p>
        <h6 class="MRS_LINDE">MRS LINDE.</h6>
            <p>What do you mean, Nora?</p>
        <h6 class="NORA">NORA.</h6>
            <p9 class="direction">_[gently]_.</p9> 
            <p>Poor Christine, you are a widow.</p>
        <h6 class="MRS_LINDE">MRS LINDE.</h6>
            <p>Yes; it is three years ago now.</p>
        <h6 class="NORA">NORA.</h6>
            <p>Yes, I knew; I saw it in the papers. I assure you, Christine, I meant
            ever so often to write to you at the time, but I always put it off and
            something always prevented me.</p>
        <h6 class="MRS_LINDE">MRS LINDE.</h6>
            <p>I quite understand, dear.</p>
        <h6 class="NORA">NORA.</h6>
            <p>It was very bad of me, Christine. Poor thing, how you must have
            suffered. And he left you nothing?</p>
        <h6 class="NORA">NORA.</h6>
            <p>It’s a shame to say that. I do really save all I can.</p>
        <h6 class="HELMER">HELMER.</h6>
            <p9 class="direction">_[laughing]_.</p9> 
            <p>That’s very true,—all you can. But you can’t save anything!</p>
        <h6 class="NORA">NORA.</h6>
            <p9>_[smiling quietly and happily]_.</p9> 
            <p></p>You haven’t any idea how many expenses we skylarks and squirrels have, Torvald.</p>
        <p><h6>HELMER.</h6>
        You are an odd little soul. Very like your father. You always find some
        new way of wheedling money out of me, and, as soon as you have got it,
        it seems to melt in your hands. You never know where it has gone.
        Still, one must take you as you are. It is in the blood; for indeed it
        is true that you can inherit these things, Nora.
        </p>
        <p><h6>NORA.</h6>
        Ah, I wish I had inherited many of papa’s qualities.
        </p>
        <h6>HELMER.</h6>
        <p>And I would not wish you to be anything but just what you are, my sweet
        little skylark. But, do you know, it strikes me that you are looking
        rather—what shall I say—rather uneasy today?
        </p>
        <p><h6>NORA.</h6>
        Do I?
        </p>
        <p><h6>HELMER.</h6>
        You do, really. Look straight at me.
        </p>
        <p><h6>NORA.</h6>
       <p>_[looks at him]_.</p> Well?
