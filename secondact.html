        <p class="speech_NORA"> You haven’t any idea how many expenses
            we skylarks and squirrels have, Torvald.</p>
    <h6 class="MRS_LINDE">MRS LINDE.</h6>
        <p class="speech_MRS_LINDE">You are an odd little soul. Very like your father. You always find some
            new way of wheedling money out of me, and, as soon as you have got it,
            it seems to melt in your hands. You never know where it has gone.
            Still, one must take you as you are. It is in the blood; for indeed it
            is true that you can inherit these things, Nora.</p>
    <h6 class="NORA">NORA.</h6>
        <p class="speech_NORA">Ah, I wish I had inherited many of papa’s qualities.</p>
    <h6 class="MRS_LINDE">MRS LINDE.</h6>
        <p class="speech_MRS_LINDE">And I would not wish you to be anything but just what you are, my sweet
            little skylark. But, do you know, it strikes me that you are looking
            rather—what shall I say—rather uneasy today?</p>
    <h6 class="NORA">NORA.</h6>
        <p class="speech_NORA">Do I?</p>

        <p class="speech_MRS_LINDE">Hasn’t Miss Sweet Tooth been breaking rules in town today?</p>
    <h6 class="NORA">NORA.</h6>
        <p9 class="direction">_[going to the table on the right]_. </p9> 
        <p class="speech_NORA">I should not think of going against your wishes.</p>
